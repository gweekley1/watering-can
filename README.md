# Watering Can

Watering Can is a lightweight app for tracking when you should water your plants. Each
watering schedule is a list entry on the main activity. Each entry tells you which plant it
refers to, when it next needs to be watered, and how often it needs to be watered. When adding
a schedule, you enter the plant's/schedule's name, the reference date by which the schedule
is calculated (in MM/DD/YY format), and the how often to water the plant (in days).

The app also allows the user to specify if and when the app will first display a notification, 
and how often to remind the user afterward.
